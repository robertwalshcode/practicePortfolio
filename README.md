# My Portfolio

## What is this?
This is my first attempt at making a portfolio page. I hope it will represent me well as a person and as a developer.

## Why is it on GitHub?
I want to make GitHub the home for my coding projects so it is natural to put it here.

## What Features does it have?

This webpage will have a few features including:

1. An About Me section
2. A showcase of all my best and recent projects
3. A contact form so you can reach out to me from there if you wish!
